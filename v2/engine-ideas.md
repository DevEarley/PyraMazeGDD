# Formatting text
use a character for formatting. It will need to be escaped if used outside of context? Can also be used to show images.
Up to the runtime environment to figure out what to do with the formatting. It can choose to ignore it.

# Time navigation
Dot Sequence was going to be the solution here. it would act like .go[time]
Maybe it just needs better naming. It's really getting a point on a circle's edge (clock)
