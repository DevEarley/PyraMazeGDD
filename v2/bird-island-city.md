- 1100 Mugs
 Family -  The Mugs Family house used to be the Mayor's house. It was the first house you would see when you came over to the island. The "Main Street" parade would end as floats would drive by the mayor's front porch where Mayor Mugs would stand and wave. 

 Now the Mugs family has abandoned the house and long left the island. The front door has Posted Private Property signs and the windows have wood planks on them. The island's residents have planted large hedges and palm trees around the house in an attempt to hide the shameful house.

 What happened to the Mugs? They had a long history on this island and one day the entire family seemed to just - vanish.

- 1300 Orod
 Single - Orod is the only one left in his family. He lives alone in his house. His father used to be an assistant to Mayor Mugs. John Orod runs the marina and is known as the town grump. He never had a wife or kids. He seems to know something and isn't saying. He can be found in he garden in the morning, in the marina every day and then in the Oldest House every Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. 

- 1200 Thmat
 Single - Jill Thmat runs the pharmacy counter. She keeps guns and grenades in a fridge under the counter. She seems to be always on edge, like at any moment someone is going to rob her blind. She says her momma taught her to never trust nobody.

Jill Thmat speaks with restraint. She compares herself to a snake backed into a corner that is ready to strike at any moment. She is warm to the 'good' people on the island. She says the rest of the people on the island are just normal, and normal people are terrible. 

A man comes into the pharmacy after hearing a rumor about Jill's guns at the Resort bar. 
Drunk - "Are you  'Mamma Jill'?" 

Jill - "Howdy, welcome, why yes I am. Now how can I help you today?"

Drunk - "Holy! Wow! So, so.. Is it true what they say? I can't believe -"

Jill - "Well that depends on what you think is true, if it's that I am a good pharmasist than yes, it's true"

Drunk - "Oh, HICK! you know that isn't -"

Jill - "If you think that my momma taught me right, then yes, also true."

Drunk - "Your - momma ?"

Jill - "She taught me to keep a hand on my gun especially when drunk men come around asking about my gun."

Drunk - "Oh...HYUCK!"

Jill - "Now let me ask you, do is it true that I keep my finger on the cock or the trigger?"

Drunk - "The cock?"

Jill - "No I cocked it when you walked in here, It's been on the trigger since you opened your sorry mouth."

Drunk - "I am sorry to bother you Maâ€™am! I'll just be on my way. HICK!"
