# PyraMaze A to B story structure.

You play as Chip. He works at a greenhouse on a small island off the east coast of US in 1946. Chip is getting long in the tooth, getting into his mid-thirties. He never went to college. Most people don't during this time in history. A professor from a local college is visiting the resort that owns the greenhouse. You, Chip, bumps into her at the resort bar. 

You only bump into the professor at the bar after you have broken the first gameplay loop at the greenhouse.
