# Bird's Eye Maze

Bird's eye is useful. It's optional to start, but required to finish.

What is the "Hero's Journey" for Bird's Eye?

## Call to Adventure
You dream about some strange patterns that you noticed around town. You wake up after dreaming about people chasing you on a boat. The last thing you remember is climbing a seemingly impossible staircase up and up trying to get to your cabin. 


## Threshold
You need to break away from your normal loop.
The guide mocks you each day you wake up. Only on the third day of playing (it would be a friday) can you leave the 3025 property (greenhouse). It's not really in your contract, but you feel like it's your duty to be there during weekdays. (At least thats what you tell people. Really, you just don't have anything to do.)

## Helper & Mentor
You can't leave on Mon - Thursday. You can only leave Fri-Sun if you take a shower and you shave. Otherwise the guide will talk to you for too long and you will need to go to bed. Otherwise the guide will get pissed off and leave you alone to do the work that you need to do. Then it's off to the bar in the resort. The guide won't be there and you won't feel discouraged to leave.

You help out the bar tender and you meet the professor.
You meet the Professor and Warp


## Just Helper
You loose the Professor


## Make Sacrifice
You quit your job.


## Gain ability
An orange bird flies around you and quickly zooms up to the sky. The camera follows and you are now looking down from above. This will help you solve puzzles and gain a new perspective.

## Make another sacrifice
You also have to leave the greenhouse behind. You will miss it.


## Return with changes
