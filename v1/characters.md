# Characters

> The professor will be a major character in the story but will remain nameless and descriptionless. This also includes gender identity. They/them pronouns should be used when describing professor. The mystery of the professor's identity is an important aspect of this story.

As you read the professor's notes you gain deeper insight into what kind of person the professor was. You also begin to understand their fate. 

The professor has a secret about you you. They have planned all of this to happen exactly as it has. All to help out Warp.

> you never understood why the professor chose them to come along to this mission. you learns that Warp has plans for you and the professor has been working with Warp for years. They tracked you down and found you. 

## You (Player)
Unwilling participant in a grand scheme. 

> Player Design Guidelines:
>
> Always refer to the player as "You". You are almost always on screen, but again there should be no identifying information outside of you avatar. You wear baggy clothing and are gender neutral. It should be easy for anyone to identify with you on screen. If a man were to play the game, they should just as easily identify. A good example of this is Link from Zelda series. A poor example of this is Mario. Link is clearly male, but has few masculine features. In BOTW Link has longer hair and easily fits in with the Geurdo (all female clan). Mario has a mustache and a large belly. But because Mario is such a cartoonish character, it is easy for anyone to connect with him. If Mario was realistic, he would be more appealing to plumbers in NY and that is about it. Link is less cartoony and has more serious tones. If Link was more of a "Manly-Man" it would be more difficult to connect with him. For example if Link acted like Duke Nukem, it would undermine his sacrifice and make the story of the Zelda games more focused on Link and less on Hyrule. 

## Temple Guardian (Creep)
Created to make progression in the temple impossible for anyone who isn't worthy. They challenge those who enter by waiting a certain time for any challenger to complete a puzzle. If they can't finish in time, the guardian resets the puzzle and warps the challenger to it's nest. The challenger is given as many chances as they need, but are locked into the puzzle at this time. If a challenger isn't able to complete the puzzle, they can keep trying until they die from dehydration. The guardians keep the bones of fallen challengers to remind all the danger of the challenge.

## The Impossible People
The impossible people are found all over the world. That is why they are called impossible. How could a people be worldwide without modern forms of transportation like cars and planes? The Impossible people invented Warp and teleportation technology before the rest of the world was using fire. They had impossible technology and had impossible resources. The professor is the first and only other person who knows of these people. you will discover more and more about them as they play the game. Warp will explain some things about the impossible people and so will the professor's notes.

## Warp
Created by the impossible people after they invented the ability to teleport. The Creep was almost like the Warp's father. These two are the first Dimensionals created. Moving forward, Dimensionals would be born. The events of PyraMaze lead to the birth of the first Dimensional baby.
