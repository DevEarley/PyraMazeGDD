# Ice Grapple Maze
This maze has three parts: Intro, Caverns & Cliffs.

The intro starts on top of a frozen lake. You navigate up the path to the temple entrance. Warp is waiting for you and teleports you to a cavern. 

Inside the cavern you are given the Ice Grapple ability. You can grapple to any parts of the ceiling that are Icy. You can use the ability to swing around to sections of the cavern you wouldn't be able to access otherwise.

Once you complete the puzzles inside the cavern, Warp takes you outside to the cliffs. Two opposing cliffs have tunnels bore by wind and man. Each tunnel has different secrets and Warp is at the top of these Cliffs. Use all of your abilities so far to navigate all the way to the top.
