# Ice Grapple Maze
This maze has three parts: Intro, Caverns & Cliffs.

The intro starts on top of a frozen lake. You navigate up the path to the temple entrance. Warp is waiting for you and teleports you to a cavern. 

Inside the cavern you are given the Ice Grapple ability. You can grapple to any parts of the ceiling that are Icy. You can use the ability to swing around to sections of the cavern you wouldn't be able to access otherwise.

Once you complete the puzzles inside the cavern, Warp takes you outside to the cliffs. Two opposing cliffs have tunnels bore by wind and man. Each tunnel has different secrets and Warp is at the top of these Cliffs. Use all of your abilities so far to navigate all the way to the top. 

## Musical Direction
For the Ice Grapple Maze.. aka the Mountain. I think we need 3 tracks total.
First track is down in a valley looking up at a mountain. It's snowing and there is a temple in the distance. I think a very spaced out track with big gaps in between melodies would be perfect. Sort of a way to reflect how quiet the snow makes things. Second track is in a cavern and you will have the new Ice Grapple ability. This should be thrilling and fun. Third track would be for the cliffs. They are dangerous and windy. Maybe a balance of quietness and sudden energy.
