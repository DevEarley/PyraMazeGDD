## City Chapter

This story starts on a small island called {City Name}. This island has a single bridge and a single port. It's small enough to have no post office but big enough for a huge beach-side resort. 

On the mainland side of the bridge, a large cruise liner is docked off the massive port. This island is a refreshing place to stay compared to the dirty industrial park to the west. 

Further west are large oil tanks with a strange amount of traffic for a storage facility. 

The three locations are it for miles in any direction in this coastal county. Cut off from the rest of the world, the ports are the main source of new comers. hardly anyone drives in off the highway besides huge trucks with payloads headed to france and spain. 

The resort built on this island is invasive to the locals. They had a small, tight economy and the resort sort of consumed it all to itself. tourists didn't need the amenities of the rest of the island. Like a vestigial appendage, the rest of the island shriveled up after each generation. The remaining island population still survived. The locals liked to congregate at a bar and inn that was one of the first structures ever built on the island. This old building had even predated the ports. Some say it was the reason the big port to the west was built. It used to be world famous. Now it is hardly visited, even by the tourists on the island. 

You, the player, were born on this island. You work at the resort. There is a small greenhouse where they grow exotic food. Your job is to tend to the green house and help in the kitchen at night. You live in the greenhouse shed and get meals for free. You don't make much money though. You go to a university on the mainland. You are studying ancient civilizations. You are interested in the Professors work because you heard about an ancient civilization that used to live on the island. 

One day, after your shift, you find yourself at the bar chatting with the bartender. The bartender is breaking down boxes and you are trying to toss the bottles into a bin. (Just like fireball tossing). You throw your last bottle, but just before you do, the Professor walks into the bar. You miss. 

The bartender stops what they were doing and you find a seat next to the professor. There is not a ton of room at this bar. The bar tender looks delivers two drinks to you and the Professor.

Bartender: "Thanks for your help. This one is on me."
-1- You: "They are always on you!"
 -1-1- Bartender: "Ha Ha! It's cheaper than paying you!"
-2- You: "Thanks!"
 -2-1- Bartender: "You are welcome my friend."
-3- You: "What did the Professor do to get a freebie?"
 -3-1- Professor: "My name is on the board - see?" 

Professor: "You are one of my student's aren't you?"
-4- You: "Yes! I work - slash - live here at the resort."
 -4-1- "You don't say! What is your degree?"
-5- "Yeah! Can I ask you a few questions?"
 -5-1- "Can't it wait till class? I am off the clock."
     -5-1-1- "It's not about school, I mean, it's not about my homework or anything like that"
         -5-1-1-1- "Ok, What is it then?"
     -5-1-2- "Ok, we can talk later."

From there you learn about the Professor and becomes friends with her. She takes you under her wing as her pupil. She likes how inquisitive you are and also sees something else in you. She thinks you might be the key to her problems. One night, back at the bar, you discuss in detail about the Impossible People and the Professor is telling you about something she calls "Warp".

She wants to find one and discover it's secrets deep in the jungles of South America. You agree to go with her and you go back to your shed to pack. You don't have much. Not even a tent. You should go down to the old building and see if you can get a tent from your family. They have lots of weird camping and survival gear that has been passed down. 

The old building is taller than the other buildings, but only by a floor or two. It has a few windows that are level with your shoes. You bend down and peer through the windows you see a lively bunch of people singing karaoke in a pub. A very bored bartender is watching and tapping his fingers to the song. 

## Mountain Chapter

## Jungle Chapter

PyraMaze's story starts with the Professor. She studied ancient civilizations and did her dissertation on a lost race known as the Impossible People. 

Warp has three siblings: Guardian, Star and Mini.

Mini has a limited vocabulary and can only teleport the player short distances. Mini speaks in poetry and usually regarding the location it will teleport you to.

Star is limited by how many times you can interact with them and when you do interact with them, time slows down. Each time you speak to Star, you unlock new options. So speak to Star often!

Guardian was the first creation of the Impossible People. Guardian cannot speak and can only move objects along with itself. Guardian can quickly move between locations but cannot teleport. As soon as it's activated, Guardian needs to sleep so it has enough energy to move whatever it needs to move. While it sleeps, a ticking sound can be heard. Once it has rested, it needs time to lock on to the target before it moves it. As soon as it's done locking on it consumes the target and moves rapidly to it's nest. there it releases the target and deactivates. Awaiting to repeat the cycle here or somewhere else. It uses a network of tubes to move between locations. Guardian tubes can be used to traverse the level, but the guardian is protective of it's tubes and is activated any time they are used without it's consent.

The four of them feel like there are more of their kind, living in the multiverse. They also feel this sense of dread. They "hear" a really disturbing sound coming from the future. It worries them and they wish to reach out to the others so they can make sense of it all.

The professor found herself drawn to this same disturbing sound coming from the edges of space and time. Her research led her to discovering Warp. 

She came across a cave with drawings depicting an ancient civilization who created unthinkable technologies. They used this tech to transport themselves all across the globe. Theses people's artifacts are found all over the world and are known as the "Impossible People". Scientists couldn't find a sensible explanation. The professor believed in the simplest reasoning, they could teleport. And they could. 

Mini was the first breakthrough for the impossible people. They didn't use the same kind of math as we do today. It was not base 10 and it wasn't like anything we use now and it it lost to time. Mini is made of rock and metal. Two pyramids float on top of a tall and narrow base. The entire thing seems to vibrate. If you listen to it closely, it sounds like it hums. The Impossible People realized that they could teach Mini certain concepts and even to speak. The limitation though was that Mini didn't speak in any language, but instead transferred it's thoughts to the user's mind. A universal language of feeling and ideas represented by images and memories of the user. If Mini wanted to say "Mountain" they would remind the user of a mountain the user had climbed as a child. 

Warp, Guardian, Mini and Star are all temporally locked to this dimension. This is frustrating and painful for them. They are all multi dimensional beings and by locking them in one dimension is like locking a person in a very small, windowless room.

The professor could not speak with any of the dimensionals at first. She needed a conduit of some kind. The Impossible People described a warrior who will complete the final step in their plan. This warrior conduit would need to train with the dimensionals in order to master the abilities required to
