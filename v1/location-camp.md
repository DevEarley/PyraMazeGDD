# Camp

You find yourself alone, left to wander. You notice a book leaning against a stump. It's one of the professor's notebooks! You read that the professor has gone and left you. The professor warns not to venture out and to wait for the professor. Of course you ignore the good professor's warning and you head out alone. 

You follow the stairs that lead down into the excavation site. Along the way you meet Warp. A strange creature made of stone shapes. It tells you about the professor and urges you to continue on (opposite the professor's tone. more encouraging)
