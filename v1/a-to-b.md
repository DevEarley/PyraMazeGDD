# Story A to B

## High level - 3 Story Arcs, so 3 loops. 

1) The Jungle
- Unlock your potential. Learn about the different abilities you can gain. Begin to understand how this is bigger than you.
- You have to sign up for this challenge. There is no going back. 

2) The Mountain
- Unlock your heart. Learn about the perspective the other dimensionals. Start to empathize with them and you start to take responsibility of their problems.
- You have to go to the future, you will never come back to this life again. 

3) The City
 - Unlock your perspective/mind. Meet Professor. Learn about impossible people. Feel prejudice because you work at the resort. Discover the HUB and meet Warp.
 - You have to give up the life you have become used to.
- Each time the loop ends, it returns you to the HUB. you can always go back to the city. If you do, the people may have new things to say to you.

## Start - Tiny intro area. Small scene with some basic platforming. Get feel for controls and menu.

Ideas for sounds:
- Mini should have variations of 5 syllables, 7 and 5. 

Ideas for a consequences:
- City is sinking into the sea. You need to find out why.
- You learn about the dimensionals and you grow to care about them.
- You want to help the professor.

Ideas for calls to adventure:
- You find your life to be a grind. You feel like an outcast inside the community you grew up in.
- You find out about the Dimensionals, the Professor and the city.
- You find out about the trip to the future and how you play a role in everything.

Dimensionals:
- Some can see into the future
- TimeWarp can teleport things between times.
  - Chip will slip into another Chip's life in the future. They both live in a resort and tend to a greenhouse. Chip JR is in the future off on a mission. Chip SR is from the past and looks just like Chip JR.
    - The fact the Chip JR looks like Chip SR and that they have a similar occupation makes Chip ideal for this task.

HUB
- Under the city. A small river runs underground. If you follow it, you will reach the HUB. The HUB links the city to all different parts of the world. 

- Each spoke of the HUB takes the player to another corner of the world.

- The Jungle, The City, The Mountain, The Graveyard, The HUB Entrance, TBD...

Impossible people
- Built all of this for you. because you best fit their plans. They need to make sure you are ready.

- Only some of them know about you. Most of them went to the "far" future and fucked up existence. Time is weird though, your dimension has not been affected. It won't be affected if you do your part. It will be affected, like others, if you fail. But because this is a linear game, you only fail if you don't finish the game.

- The ones who stayed behind grew an appreciation for time. They grew prosperous but were wiped out by prejudice and disease. The ones left live on this island with you. You are one of their many grandchildren.

## Story Intro ( comfort zone / call to adventure - THE LOOP ) -
 The call to adventure happens in two parts, the first part is an awakening of your perspective then the second part is an awakening of your mind.  Your perspective changes when you meet the professor and find the hidden caves under the city. 
 
 You wake up in greenhouse. a tour comes by and you are not ready. You go to a bar for dinner. You explore the city. You come home and go to bed. REPEAT.
 
 You need to break free from your loop. Each day you notice something different. Until you understand what you have to do in order to break free. You need to confront the people who hate you. 

 You do this by platforming up to the roof of the "Old House". Before you can get to the roof, you need to go through the back gate. This will lead you into the courtyard. Make your way upstairs and then you will need the ladder key. You can only access the ladder at a certain time. Once you access the ladder, you can enter the "Old House" from the top of the stair well. The stairs lead you down into a large garage like area. you must avoid anyone working in here. It seems like they are filling crates with kind of rock. As you make your way down below the garage, you find yourself in some kind of office. You leave the office and are now in a kitchen and you can also see a large staircase that leads underground. You can see the iconic "Old House" underground bridge. That bridge leads to the entrance of the restaurant. You make your way down a long hall that leads deeper and deeper into the earth. You will need the more abilities to continue any further.

Now that you are aware of the maze, you feel compelled to ask the professor about it later at the bar. 

That night triggers the "Supernatural Aid" and the Final call to adventure.

## Threshold Guardians & Threshold - You need to learn how to break from your loop. 

You have to learn how to be in the right place at the right time.

# Mentor & Helper
You and the professor embark on a journey together. 

# Need or desire is clearly defined
You start to get a hint that you are special for some reason.

# Temptation
What is the temptation?

# Only Helper
You are separated from the Professor and all you have are the Dimensionals.

# Abyss
You find Warp's graveyard.

# Get what you wanted


# Return (Having Changed)

# Transform

# Atonement (Get what they wanted - You have to give up something. You have to make a personal sacrifice)
You thought all of these abilities came without a cost. But you were wrong. You are now DESTINED to fix this dimension. You don't have a way out. The Impossible people made it clear, you always had a choice to back out. Now you do not have that choice. And they warned you.

# But Pay a price (ANOTHER personal sacrifice)
Your freedom is gone. Your life in the 40's is over. The plants in the greenhouse wither and die. The space is converted into a chlorine pool and bar. 

# Gift of the Goddess  (A lack-luster pay off that you will have to make the best of.)
You get to go to the future. You have to sign a contract stating that you will not tell anyone from the past and that you are aware that you cannot and should not come back to the past with the information you have gained from the future. 

# Return to the city and prepare to face new challenges

# Each time we try to call
