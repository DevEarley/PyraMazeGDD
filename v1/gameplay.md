# Gameplay

PyraMaze is 3D adventure puzzle platformer. The driver of the player's motivation to play is the mystery of the game's lore. They are motivated because the mystery is so enticing, they are willing to get lost in mazes, perform tricky platforming and complete timed puzzles. The satisfaction of finishing a puzzle is secondary to the satisfaction of finding more information about the game's lore. 

## Abilities

Moonlight - Used to activate various puzzle elements. The first ability gained. Required for all other abilities. Glorified "use" button.
Fireball - Toss a fireball into an urn. This is tricky because the fireball is a physical ball that will bounce and roll. It can also light flame-able objects. Goes out instantly in the snow.
Birds Eye - Ability allows you to see things from a bird's eye perspective. Helps players navigate the various mazes and is required in certain mazes with visual puzzle elements.
Ice Grapple - Will launch the player towards any icy surfaces. 

Once you gain a new ability an animation plays that illustrates how you will use it.
